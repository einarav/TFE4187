# TFE4187 Analog CMOS 1 Term project
Git for term project in TFE4187 (Analog CMOS 1) by Einar. Though it was not required I created a design note which summarizes the simulations of the amplifier, which can be viewed in [Design review](https://github.com/einarav/TFE4187/blob/main/Design%20review.pdf).
## Virtuoso
Design and simulations where done in Cadence Virtuoso.
## MATLAB
Simulation results where plotted using MATLAB.
